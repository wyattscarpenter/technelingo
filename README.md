# technelingo

I grow tired of programming languages, and their arbitrary conventions, and wish to have one that just follows normal typographical conventions, like from math and stuff. I may call this "technelingo", after the Greek word "techne" and the English word "lingo" â€” unless I find out that some other project, like an online math proof language project, has already gotten to this idea first.
